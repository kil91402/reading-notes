###When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?  You should use an unordered list when the order of the list doesn't matter.
###How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?            By using the <type> attribute you are able to change the bullet type.
###When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?                                                                                      You use an ordered list when a list must be in a specified order, if the order doesn't matter then you can apply the unordered list.
###Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?                                                        If you use the <reversed> attribute it changes the number order from high to low.  If you use the <type> attribute you can change the numbering style.  E.g. (Roman Numerals vs Numbers)

##The Box ModelLinks to an external site..

###Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?                Both margin and padding properties are:  bottom, left, right, top.  The margin is the outerlayer around the box in the border, padding, and content fit in.  The padding sits between the border and pushes content away from the border.
###List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.                                                                                    Content box is the area that shows your content. Padding box is the space around your content.  Border box wraps the content and the padding.  Margin box is the outermost layer that wraps content padding and border between the box and other elements.

###What data types can you store inside of an Array? Boolean, numbers, strings, characters and objects are data types you can store inside of an Array
###Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why? const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];
###List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.  x += f(): addition; x -= f():  subtraction; x *= f():  multiplication; x **= f():  exponential;  x &&= f():  Logical AND.
###Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.  I am totally unsure about this answer but I'm thinking it will come back undefined.  If I look at it from a math perspective, I can't add variables and numbers.  

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

###Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program. 6>5 is an If example that would be true because 6 is greater than 5.

###Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript. We use loops to perform repeated tasks. The run repeatedly unless they comeback as false. For example, if you set a variable (x) to less than 8 and have x = 1, you run your console.log as x+++ and set your variable as i<8, it should run an output of the numbers 1-7
