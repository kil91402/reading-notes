###In order to be able to understand programming and development, it is important to know the anatomy and structure behind building a website and or program.  

###With HTTP, web browsers send request to web servers for web pages and images.  Once the request is done by the server, the connection between the browser and server  across the internet is disconnected.

###When describing how HTML, CSS, and JS are parsed, HTML files are parsed first.  The browser starts acknowledging link element references and scrip element references.  Request are then sent to the server for CSS files that were found from link elements and Javascripts found from script elements.  CSS and Javascripts are parsed.

###The browser generates from parsed HTML.  An in memory DOM tree generates in memory CSSOM structure from parsed CSS and compiles and excecutes the parsed Javascript.  The browser then builds DOM Tree, applies styles from CSSOM tree and executes the Java Script.

###When applying images to websites, use google images to search.  Right click on the image and save as an image or copy the web address of that said image.  Use Google's license filter to avoid copyright issues.

###Javascript: String vs  a Number:

###String is enclosed in single or double quote marks.  Numbers have no quotes around them.

###What are variables and their importance?  Variables is something that stores information for programming.  Variables are needed because it allows values to change.  ###Without values being able to change, you would not be able to label or personalize data.

 

###Intro to HTML

###HTML attributes gives us additional information about elements.  HTML elements consist of an opening tag, content and closing tag.

###Article vs Section elements

###Article elements are independent articles or documents that can stand on its own separate from the main content.  Section elements group documents into related sections.

###Typical elements included in a website include: DOCTYPE, HTML, head, meta, title, and body.  

###Metadata has elements like name and content that specifies content of your page thus helping make you page appear when using search engines.

 

###Website

###In order to start a website, one must know what the website is about.  What is your mission and your endgame?  In other words what are you trying to accomplish?

###When dealing with a top level heading it is better to use h1 instead of span because h1 will automatically recognize it as a top level heading.  

###Benefits of Using Semantics

###Semantic elements make pages easier to read.  It also helps search engines determine the context of web pages.

###JavaScript

###Two things that require JavaScript would be programming with 2D/3D graphics and animation.  To add JavaScript to HTML employ the HTML script tag in the head or body section depending on where you would like to load the JavaScript
